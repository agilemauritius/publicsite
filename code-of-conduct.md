## Code of Conduct


All delegates, speakers and volunteers at [Agile Mauritius User Group](https://www.meetup.com/agile-mauritius) are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the various events.

### The Quick Version

Agile Mauritius User Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free sharing and learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks.
Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the event organizers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup group.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup admin/coordinating members immediately.

Coordinating members will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the events. We value your attendance and participation.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all events venues (physical or remote) and at meetup-related social events.

This Code of Conduct is borrowed from Facebook React Conf Code of Conduct.
