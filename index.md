## Welcome to Agile Mauritius

The main purpose of the **Agile Mauritius** group is to share knowledge about Agile. If you're an Agile practitioner or simply interested in Business Agility, this group is for you!

Business agility embraces change. Business agility changes how you think, how you work and the way you interact with people.

We address these in our meetups through talks, lean coffee sessions & conferences to stay abreast with these changing market needs.

**Target audience**
Marketing, coaches, executives and small to mid size business owners looking to create a sustainable business using Agile practices.
