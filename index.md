## Welcome to Agile Mauritius

The main purpose of the **Agile Mauritius** group is to share knowledge about Agile. If you're an Agile practitioner or simply interested in Business Agility, this group is for you!

Business agility embraces change. Business agility changes how you think, how you work and the way you interact with people.

We address these in our meetups through talks, lean coffee sessions & conferences to stay abreast with these changing market needs.

**Target audience**
Marketing, coaches, executives and small to mid size business owners looking to create a sustainable business using Agile practices.

## Upcoming Event - 19 April 2022

Join us for our ninth meetup that looks at the power of Inquiry!

Do you ever feel stuck thinking of solving a problem that does not seem to be solvable?

Are you seeing the same issues emerge in different places/organisations?

Do you lie awake at night wondering what will be your next step when there are too many factors and things to consider?

Well, you are not alone.

What you have is something called a “wicked issue” and our speaker would like to share the power of Inquiry that can help influence these problems by shifting the patterns that hold them stuck.

Do not miss this learning and sharing opportunity !
