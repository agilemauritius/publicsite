## Welcome to Agile Mauritius

The main purpose of the **Agile Mauritius** group is to share knowledge about Agile. If you're an Agile practitioner or simply interested in Business Agility, this group is for you!

Business agility embraces change. Business agility changes how you think, how you work and the way you interact with people.

We address these in our meetups through talks, lean coffee sessions & conferences to stay abreast with these changing market needs.

**Target audience**
Marketing, coaches, executives and small to mid size business owners looking to create a sustainable business using Agile practices.

## Upcoming Event - 28 June 2022

Join us for our 11th meetup that looks at killing burnout!

Flight Levels were first introduced as a way to detect opportunities for organisational improvements from different organisational levels. 

During this talk, Rochelle and Mike who are the co-founders of WeDoChange.io will speak about Flight Levels and how applying flight levels can help organisations to reduce burnout in their teams.

Do not miss this learning and sharing opportunity!

Our Speakers:

**Rochelle Roos** joins us from South Africa. She loves working with highly motivated individuals and like minded teams who share my interest in adding value and moving forward. 

Applying a systems thinking approach to aligning Agile methodologies at organisational level while working with clients to build the correct cultural and context-driven practices is what drives me. 

She has coached and trained teams and individuals ranging from delivery teams to C-level executives.

**Mike Freislich** also joins us from South Africa. He loves the Kanban approach coupled with the Flight Levels Model to create inclusive, collaborative, focused, measurable, improvements within teams and organisations. 

After having been inspired by Dr. Klaus Leopold in 2015, Mike achieved his Kanban Trainer accreditation (AKT) in 2017, and Flight Levels Guide in 2020. 

He loves to work with people at all levels of the organisation to achieve true organisational agility.

His happy place is rock climbing and building synthesisers!
