## Welcome to Agile Mauritius

The main purpose of the **Agile Mauritius** group is to share knowledge about Agile. If you're an Agile practitioner or simply interested in Business Agility, this group is for you!

Business agility embraces change. Business agility changes how you think, how you work and the way you interact with people.

We address these in our meetups through talks, lean coffee sessions & conferences to stay abreast with these changing market needs.

**Target audience**
Marketing, coaches, executives and small to mid size business owners looking to create a sustainable business using Agile practices.

## Upcoming Event - 26 July 2022

Join us for our Agile Lean Coffee meetup session!

What’s more Agile than getting together to have a Lean Coffee talk? 

Whether you are new to Agile or you have been using Agile techniques for some time (and even if you don't like coffee), feel free to join us to share and discuss any Agile-related ideas or challenges you might have and gain insights from each other.
 
The session will follow basic Lean Coffee structured and agenda-free meeting (http://leancoffee.org/):
•	we shall start by everyone co-creating the agenda, with each person submitting topics they would like to discuss,
•	vote on the topics submitted,
•	then contribute to the topic discussion, 
•	and we’ll decide together when it’s time to move to the next topic. 

Please register today and bring your own Agile topics to discuss or simply join the discussion. 
Do not miss this learning and sharing opportunity!
See you there!
